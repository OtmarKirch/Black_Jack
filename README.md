This is a version of Blackjack, adapted for a capstone project for the Udemy course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp"

These are the rules of the adapted Blackjack:

- The deck is unlimited in size. 
- There are no jokers. 
- The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
- The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.

- cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
- The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
- Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
